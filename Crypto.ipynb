    "## Different crytographic terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is a generic term used to describe the design and anlysis of mechanisms based on mathematical techniques that provide fundamental security services. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of cryptography as the establishment of a large toolkit of different techniques, which can be used on their own or in combined, in security applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **cryptographic primitive ** is a cryptographic process that provides a number of specified security services. Cryptopgraphic primitives can be viewed as the basic generic tools in the cryptographic tool kit. E.g. block ciphers (deterministic algorithms operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks, with an unvarying transformation specified by a symmetric key), message authentication codes, hash functions, and digital signature schemes. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **cryptographic algorithm** is the particular specification of a cryptographic primitive. E.g. AES is a cryptographic algorithm that specifies a block cipher. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **crypto system** is often used to refer to the implementation of some cryptographic primitives and their accompanying infrastructure. A cryptosystem used for confidentiality may consist of a block cipher as well as the users, the keys and the key management. "

    "## Cryptography concepts for developers\n",
    "Source: an open source online book on practical cryptography https://cryptobook.nakov.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is the science of providing security and protection of information. It is used everywhere in our digital world: when you open a Web site, send an email or connect to the WiFi network. That's why developers should have at least basic understanding of cryptography and how to use crypto algorithms and crypto libraries, to understand hashing, symmetric and asymmetric ciphers and encryption schemes, as well as digital signatures and the cryptosystems and algorithms behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encryption and Keys**\n",
    "Cryptography deals with storing and transmitting data in a secure way, such that only those, for whom it is intended, can read and process it. This may involve encrypting and decrypting data using symmetric or asymmetric encryption schemes, where one or more keys are used to transform data from plain to encrypted form and back. \n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetric encryption (like AES) uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages, while asymmetric encryption uses a public-key cryptosystem (like RSA) and a key-pair: public key (encryption key) and corresponding private key (decryption key).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography deals with **keys** (large secret numbers) and in many scenarios these keys are derived from numbers, passwords or passphrases using **key derivation algorithms** (like PBKDF2 and Scrypt).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digital Signatures** and **Message Authentication**\n",
    "Cryptography provides means of digital signing of messages which guarantee message authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. Most digital signature algorithms (like DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA) use asymmetric key pair (private and public key): the message is signed by the private key and the signature is verified by the corresponding public key. In the bank systems digital signatures are used to sign and approve payments. In blockchain signed transactions allow users to transfer a blockchain asset from one address to another.\n",
    "Cryptography deals with message authentication algorithms (like HMAC) and message authentication codes (MAC codes) to prove message authenticity, integrity and authorship. Authentication is used side by side with encryption, to ensure secure communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secure Random Numbers**\n",
    "Cryptography uses random numbers and deals with entropy (unpredictable randomness) and secure generation of random numbers (e.g. using CSPRNG). Secure random numbers are unpredictable by nature and developers should care about them, because broken random generator means compromised or hacked system or app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Exchange**\n",
    "Cryptography defines key-exchange algorithms (like Diffie-Hellman key exchange) and key establishment schemes, used to securely establish encryption keys between two parties that intend to transmit messages securely using encryption. Such algorithms are performed typically when a new secure connection between two parties is established, e.g. when you open a modern Web site or connect to the WiFi network. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptographic Hashes and Password Hashing**\n",
    "Cryptography provides cryptographic hash functions (like SHA-3), which transform messages to message digest (hash of fixed length), which cannot be reversed back to the original message and almost uniquely identifies the input. In blockchain systems, for example, hashes are used to generate blockchain addresses, transaction ID and in many other algorithms and protocols. \n",
    "\n",
    "Password hashing and password to key derivation functions (like Scrypt) protect user passwords and password encrypted documents and data by securely deriving a hash (or key) from a text-based passwords, injecting random parameters (salt) and using a lot of iterations and computing resources to make password cracking slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this python notebook, we are going to introduce some **common cryptographic primitives** that developers should know, and demonstrate some of their example use in python."
